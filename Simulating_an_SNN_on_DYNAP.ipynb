    "# Simulating a Spiking Neural Network on DYNAP-SE\n",

    "Developed by [Yigit Demirag](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/fw1/modules/ini/ini.php/people/yigit) and [Giacomo Indiveri](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/fw1/modules/ini/ini.php/people/giacomo). Adapted and extended for the course [D7064E](https://www.ltu.se/edu/course/D70/D7064E/D7064E-Neuromorf-informationsbehandling-1.225526?l=en) by Fredrik Sandin.\n",

    "In this exercise you will simulate the silicon neuron and synapse circuits of a neuromorphic processor named DYNAP-SE1, shown in the figure below. Specifically, you will first see how a Differential Pair Integrator (DPI) silicon circuit is used in Dynap-SE1 to implement the fundamental dynamics of synapses and Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons. The AdEx model of neurons is described in Chapters 5 and 6 in the Neuronal Dynamics [book](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Pt2.html). Then you will learn how to set up neuron and synapse parameters, form networks of spiking neurons, and monitor the electrical signals at various stages in the chip. Finally, you will investigate the adaptive behavior of the neurons.\n",

    "Depending on your background knowledge you may or may not be able to figure out (with reasonable effort) how the synapse and neuron circuits function. Do not feel discouraged if underlying aspects of the hardware simulation are difficult to understand. After all, how much do you know about the inner workings of a modern CPU or GPU, and the transistor circuits actually used to implement the logic gates? As programmers and engineers we can anyway be productive by understanding such things at some level of abstraction. Few know the details well. Similarly, for neuromorphic hardware we must establish and learn abstract concepts that are useful for system design and engineering purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will enable you to familiarize with some unique features of **dynamic** neuromorphic processors, abstractions that are key to understanding what Neuromorphic Computing is about and how it is different from Digital Computing. There is plenty of room for deepening your knowledge of the DYNAP-SE1 and dynamic neuromorphic processors by studying the references provided below and in the associated lectures.\n",

    "## Examination\n",

    "There are several tasks below involving investigations that require visualisation and modification of parameter values. Read the associated text carefully and do your best to understand how/why the modifications done provide the expected result (with the time given for this exercise).

    "\n",
    "The computational principles of the brain are vastly different from conventional computers. Rather than using Boolean logic, clocked operation, and distinct memory and processing units, the biological brain works at massively parallel, fault-tolerant, asynchronous manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In neuromorphic engineering, we aim to design compact, energy-efficient computational devices that directly _emulate_ the style of computation of the brain with **the physics of the silicon.** To achieve that, we use analog Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to implement neural and synaptic circuits and integrate into Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) devices. In these architectures, time represents itself (no clock) - neurons process the incoming spikes as they arrive and produce output spikes in real-time. Consequently, to process real-world sensory signals efficiently, neuromorphic systems use circuits with biologically plausible time constants that match environment statistics ($\\sim 10-100$ ms). \n",
    "\n",
    "The DPI circuit shown below is the fundamental building block used to implement silicon neurons and synapses with tunable time-constants (for details see the paper by Chicca et al referenced below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![DPI circuit](figures/DPI_advanced.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is totally fine if you do not understand how this circuit works. The essence is that it has the response dynamics, i.e., the relation of input current $I_{i n}$ and output current $I_{out}$ of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau \\frac{d}{d t} I_{o u t}+I_{o u t}=\\frac{I_{g}}{I_{\\tau}} I_{i n},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau \\triangleq C U_{T} / \\kappa I_{\\tau}$ ($C$ the capacitor, $U_T$ thermal voltage, $\\kappa$ subthreshold slope factor). The DPI circuit can be tuned by adjusting the time constant by $I_{\\tau}$ and the gain factor by $I_{g}$. Thus, the DPI circuit is simply a current-mode low pass filter with adjustable gain and time-constant. This is the building block of silicon neurons and synapses in the DYNAP-SE1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Silicon Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "![Neuron circuit](figures/neuron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above schematic shows the neuron circuit implementing Adaptive Exponential Integrate & Fire (AdEx) on Dynap-SE1. AdEx neurons are introduced by [Brette and Gerstner, 2005](https://www.readcube.com/library/a457847f-fdff-4d66-a32a-b3830a010b34:72216f6a-1527-440d-b775-be66fa7085a1) that capable of describing known neuronal firing patterns, e.g., adapting, bursting, delayed spike initiation, initial bursting, fast-spiking, and regular spiking. We will not go into detail of circuit analysis but describe the functional blocks. The yellow block is the input DPI circuit modeling neuron's leak conductance. The green block implements an additional low-pass ﬁlter that integrates the spikes and produces a slow current $I_{ahp}$ responsible for spike-frequency adaptation. The red block is a spike event generation amplifier implementing current-based positive feedback (modeling both $Na^{+}$ activation and inactivation conductances) and produces address-events at extremely low-power operation. Lastly, the blue block resets the neuron and keeps it in a resting state for a refractory period, set by the $V_{ref}$ bias voltage. Under some assumptions, the response dynamics of neuron block is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau \\frac{d}{d t} I_{m e m}+I_{m e m} \\approx I_{i n}-I_{a h p}+f\\left(I_{m e m}\\right)$$\n",
    "$$\\tau_{a h p} \\frac{d}{d t} I_{a h p}+I_{a h p} \\approx I_{a h p} \\delta\\left(t_{s p i k e}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $I_{m e m}$ is the sub-threshold current that represents the real neuron's membrane potential variable, $I_{i n}$ is the input current that enters the neuron, $I_{a h p}$ characterizes the spike adaptation effect, $\\tau$ is the time-constant of leakage current. $f(x)$ is an exponential function with positive exponent which characterizes the passive properties, i.e. $f(x) = \\alpha e^{ \\beta x - \\gamma} + \\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Silicon Synapse\n",
    "\n",
    "![Synapse circuit](figures/synapse.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the above schematic shows a typical silicon synapse circuit implemented on Dynap-SE1. The green block implements short-term depression (STD). The yellow block implements basic DPI dynamics and can be tuned to implement short-term facilitation (STF). The red block implements NMDA voltage-gated channels, and the blue block implements conductance-based voltage dependence. The simplified version of the response dynamics of the synaptic block is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau \\frac{d}{d t} I_{s y n}(t)+I_{s y n}(t)=I_{w} \\delta\\left(t_{p r e}\\right)$$\n",
    "where $I_{s y n}$ is the synaptic current, $I_{w}$ is the gain factor (weight) of the synapse, and $\\tau$ is time constant of current decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed explanations of neural and synaptic circuits (and especially the derivations and the assumptions behind the formulas mentioned) you can check [PDF available on arXiv.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6428.pdf)\n",

There are other options available (NEST, PyTorch, etc.), but Brian2 is both fast and flexible when working with spikes. More importantly, the group who developed DYNAP-SE1 has already modeled the neural and synaptic circuits that the processor implements using Brian2. Thus, it is straightforward to model DYNAP-SE1 in Brian2 and simulate spiking neural networks as if they would be running on an actual processor. Super cool :)\n",

    "# Part 3: Spike-Frequency Adaptation of DPI Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember when a smell seems to be fading after you get used to it? Such mechanisms can be implemented with spike-frequency adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In neuroscience, spike-frequency adaptation is defined as reducing a neuron's firing rate to a stimulus of constant intensity. Hence, when stimulated with a constant stimulus, many neurons initially respond with a high spike frequency that decays down to a lower steady-state frequency. There are several mechanisms by which neurons can adapt to new stimulus statistics; for example, neurons can change their time constants or other neurons suppress its firing rate via feedback inhibition. Usually, these adaptation processes are slower than the dynamics of action potential generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained briefly in the Introduction of Part 1, silicon neurons on DynapSE are capable of spike-frequency adaptation. In the DYNAP-SE1 silicon neurons, the spike-frequency adaptation mechanism is implemented by an additional DPI filter that models the neuron's Calcium conductance, producing and after-hyper-polarizing (AHP) current $I_{ahp}$ which is proportional to the neuron's mean firing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two bias currents on the chip to tune the strength of the spike-frequency adaptation (see the figure of the DPI circuit at the top and related differential equation approximation):\n",
    "\n",
    "- $I_{tauahp}$ : Leakage current for spike-frequency adaptation (how fast the adaptation is)\n",
    "- $I_{thahp}$  : Threshold for spike-frequency adaptation (strength of the adaptation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptation will then follow from the physics of the silicon and DPI circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1 and Part 2, we created various spike trains, allocated neurons, and created synapses on the Dynap-SE1 simulator. In Part 3, we will learn another fundamental block of our neuromorphic chips, called Bias Generator (BiasGen).\n",
    "\n",
    "BiasGen is a configurable current generator that biases the gate voltage of specific transistors on the chip to generate the desired currents. By BiasGen, the user can adjust neuron and synapse parameters and thus resembles \"hyperparameters\" of ANN. In research, we spend a notable amount of time tuning network parameters via BiasGen so that the network operates in a specific regime that we choose.  You can check the original paper of BiasGen [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5537475). The current version of BiasGen inside the Dynap-SE1 is much more advanced. For example, it can compensate the temperature dependency of generated currents. Despite this compensation, neuromorphic chips operating in the analog regime can be sensitive to temperature variations, see for example Figure 6 in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.00150), which is based on experiments with a DYNAP-SE1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following you will create a regular spiking pattern and tune two biases, `Itauahp` and `Ithahp,` for observing a spike-frequency adaptation. With correct values, you should see the firing rate adapting to the constant stimulus after some time. \n",
    "\n",
    "To control BiasGen, you will use the `set_bias(dict, 'core_ID')` method, which takes a dictionary of address, current pairs, and the Core ID. Core ID is required because the biases are shared within a single core of DynapSE."
